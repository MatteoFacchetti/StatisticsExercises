# Statistics Exercises
This repository contains a series of statistics exercises for Python that me and the members of my group solved
in the Statistics course of the Master of Science in Data Science and Business Analytics at Bocconi University in Milan.
Each exercise is followed by the solution that our group has proposed.

For the solution of some exercises, you will need specific datasets that you will find inside the Data folder.

The member of the group are Matteo Facchetti, Mario Damiano Russo and Mirko Frigerio.

Enjoy!
